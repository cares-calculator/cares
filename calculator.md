Welcome to the **Combined Assessment of Risk Encountered in Surgery (CARES)** surgical risk calculator. This calculator was derived from a cohort of 79,914 patients in Singapore and allows for a simplified yet accurate prediction of both postoperative mortality and need for ICU admission after surgery. The development of this calculator was published [here](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e019427)<sup>1</sup>. Please select the correct variables to generate the risk estimates.

**Disclaimer**

The CARES Surgical Risk Calculator estimates the chance of unfavourable outcomes after surgery in the form of death within 30 days after surgery and prolonged ICU admission beyond 24hours. The risk estimates generated are only estimates, based on the variables selected. This is not a patient-specific estimate, and other factors that affect outcome may not be included. The information presented here is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor or healthcare provider. The CARES Surgical Risk calculator is not responsible for medical decisions that are made based on the risk calculator estimates, since these estimates should always be correlated with the individual patient profile.
