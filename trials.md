The Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Perioperative Center selectively participates in rigorous local and multicenter international trials that aim to improve patient outcomes.

Below are the trials that are currently ongoing:

> 1&#46; **Preoperative Anemia Among the Elderly Undergoing Major Abdominal Surgery (PANAMA): Impact on Healthcare Outcomes**
> 
> ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [NCT03497416](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03497416)
>
> Preoperative anemia is a known risk factor for morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare resource utilisation.  The main objective of this study single-centre prospective observational study is to investigate the perioperative morbidity and mortality, blood transfusion rate, healthcare outcomes and patient-centric outcomes among anemic elderly patients undergoing major surgery.

> 2&#46; **Preoperative Intravenous Iron Infusion to Reduce Post-surgical Complications: a Pilot Randomised Control Trial (PIRCAS)**
>
> ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [NCT03295851](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03295851)
> 
> Preoperative anemia leads to increased rates of perioperative blood transfusion, mortality, adverse cardiac and non-cardiac complications. This study is a randomised, open-label study to investigate the efficacy of intravenous iron compared to oral iron in patients with anemia undergoing major surgery to reduce surgical complications.

>3&#46; **The Impact of Prehabilitation Bundle on Perioperative Outcome for Frail Elderly Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Surgery**
>
> ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [NCT02921932](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02921932)
>
> Frailty is a geriatric syndrome, defined as an increased vulnerability to stressors leading to a state of decreased physiological resistance. It is more prevalent among the older adult population and is associated with up to a threefold increased risk of mortality or major morbidity postsurgery. This prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arm study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a preoperative "bundle" of interventions, which consists of preoperative physiotherapy, nutritional support and cognitive exercises on elderly frail patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, and their postoperative outcomes.
